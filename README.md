## Introduction

The wave of finance in the youth of our country is rising rapidly as we witnessed a pandemic and a year-long lockdown. There are a number websites which act as a good portfolio manager or a stock screener in the Indian finance arena, but there is yet to be an application/website which would provide the convince of being both, a screener AND a portfolio manager.

The goal of our project Stock-base is to integrate the features of a typical portfolio management system and an Indian stock screener, like [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/?hl=en) and [Screener](https://www.screener.in) for example.

Stockbase would be a one-stop solution for keeping the records and updates of portfolio in check, while also acting as a good stock screener, saving peopleâ€™s time from fruitlessly juggling between different websites for researching a stock.
